<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a curious nerd who loves to learn new things. I have way too many hobbies, but some are them are IPSC shooting, dogtraining, photography martial arts and now also programming! Oh, yes, reading is also an important part of my life. In 2023 I read 96 books, mainly fantasy, but also some self-development books.</p>

<p>I have also certified my dog to be a military patrol dog, which I'm very proud of, so he and I are a K9 team for our country and ready to serve! &#9996;&#127995;</p>
<p>I would call myself an optimistic and energetic person who loves adventures and new experiences. My strengths is my curiosity, flexibility, creativity and positive outlook on life!</p>
